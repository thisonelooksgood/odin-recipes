    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Recipes written in the century following the Liber de Coquina recommended boiling the pasta in chicken broth and dressing it with cheese and chicken fat. In a recipe adapted for the Lenten fast, walnuts were recommended.</p>
    <p>lasagne meaning more than one sheet of lasagna, though in many other languages a derivative of the singular word lasagna is used for the popular baked pasta dish. Regional usage in Italy, when referring to the baked dish, favours the plural form lasagne in the north of the country and the singular lasagna in the south.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>3 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic salt</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pint part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese </li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot cook lasagna noodles in boiling salted water until al dente. Rinse with cool water. Drain.</li>
        <li>In large sauce pan cook ground beef. Drain excess grease. Combine tomato sauces and tomato paste with ground beef and simmer until bubbly. Add garlic salt and Italian seasoning and reduce heat to low simmer. Cook for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>To assemble, in the bottom of a 13x9 inch baking dish spread a thin layer of sauce. Next, add a layer of noodles, ricotta cheese, sauce/ground beef mixture, and then grated mozzarella cheese. Repeat until baking dish is filled. Garnish top with additional shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>In a preheated 375 degree F(190 degree C) oven bake for 30 minutes or until bubbly. Let stand for 15 minutes and serve.</li>
