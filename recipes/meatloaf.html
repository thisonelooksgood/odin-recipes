    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Danish meatloaf is called <em>forloren hare</em> ('mock hare') or <em>farsbrød</em> ('ground-meat bread') and is usually made from a mixture of ground pork and beef with strips of bacon or cubed bacon on top. It is served with boiled or mashed potatoes and brown gravy sweetened with red currant jam.</p>
